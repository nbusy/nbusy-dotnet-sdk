# NBusy
NBusy SDK for .NET Framework 4.5. 

## What can it be used for?
Although NBusy API is not publicly accessible yet, this source code can still be used as a nice reference for building ASP.NET Web API client library packages as it makes very good use of HttpClient (System.Net.Http) and the new async features for .NET 4.5.
